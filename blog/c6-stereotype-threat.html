        <h2>Stereotype Threat Advice</h2>

          <!-- <h3>What is a stereotype threat? </h3> -->
          <p>
            The topic for this week is stereotype threat. What is it? stereotype threat is a phenomenon in society in which people feel themselves to be at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, negative stereotypes about their social group. For example, supposed you encounter a situation where you are the only person with certain characteristics, you do not feel that you belong to that group. The thought of this situation would undermine your ability to perform well, specially in an academic environment such as when you need to take an exam (SAT, GRE, etc).
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, this blog is the most difficult cultural blog I have ever written. It's not that I have never encountered it or try to avoid this topic. It is far from that; I had grown up in this environment. However, because of this, I had grown up to have a thick skin (or a strong mind, if you will) to counter it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can see the impact a stereotype threat can have on a student in DBC as it can undermine a him or her ability to perform well. However, I think our cohort is diverse and all of them are very smart people who came from various backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any students who feel the stereotype threat, I have several advices for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, you need to understand regardless of the environment you are in, there will always be "noises" (in this case stereotype) that undermine your ability to do well. Knowledge this statement and you will have one less thing to think about. Furthermore, knowledging it is another way to block the "noise". You cannot solve a problem unless you know what you are solving, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, focus on the positive things you need to do to be successful at DBC. You have already paid a lot of money for this to become a developer. You left your old life behind. Now it is time to embrace changes that will make you a better person. Furthermore, focusing on the positive energy is counteract the negative energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever you encounter a sterotype, just remember two rules:
            <ol>
              <li>I left my old life to become a full-pledged developer after DBC. I cannot fail no matter what. Nothing can stop me. I am great!
              </li>
              <li>Remeber rule 1.</li>
            </ol> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for reading!
