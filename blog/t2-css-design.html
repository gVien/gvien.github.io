          <p>
            After a week of HTML and CSS, I had a chance to use it to complete this website, although it needs more fine-tuning in the next few weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hardest part of styling this page was to get the 3 blocks to position inline horizontally to each other underneath the header. It sounds easy but it is not; my other classmates also had difficulty with position.
          </p>
          <p>
            While working on this, I pondered about <strong>ID</strong> and <strong>Class</strong> selectors even though I mostly use <strong>Class</strong> selectors. In the back of my mind, I thought they are the same since you can use either one to do your styling and it still works. However, after digging further, I learn that by convention they should not be abused and used excessively especially <strong>IDs</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>IDs</strong> should be unique while <strong>Classes</strong> do not need to be unique. This means we can use the same classes on different elements but not for <strong>IDs</strong>. In addition, <strong>IDs</strong>have special browser functionality. What do I mean by that? when we click something on a link on a table of contents, we normally see something like http://www.domain.com/#domain, this is an attempt by the browser to locate the <strong>ID</strong> "domain" and it points to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you can see, having <strong>IDs</strong> to be unique are important. And I will make sure to not use the same <strong>IDs</strong> throughout my design!
