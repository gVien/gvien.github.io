        <h2>Thinking Style</h2>

        <section>
          <p>
            On my first week in Phase 0, I was asked to take the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Thinking Style Quiz</a> and here are my scores:
            <li>Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random: 40</li>
            <li>Abstract Random: 24</li>
            <li>Abstract Sequential: 16</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, based on the score my weakness is Abstract Sequential. This means I am not good with abstract material. The detailed explanation on <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a> provides more information about all four thinking styles.
          </p>
          <p>
          After reflecting a bit, I think that is usally the case. It normally takes longer for me to understand abstract material. However, once I can pick up the abstract materials, my learning curve runs wild.
          </p>
          <p>
          Besides CSS positioning, I did not have much problems solving problems in the last three weeks in phase 0. I solved this week Ruby's challenges pretty quickly. However, I think it is the results of spending a lot of time with Ruby many months ago. I spent a lot of time solving problems on <a href="http://coderbyte.com/">CoderByte</a>
          . Because of that, I was able to understand Ruby pretty well.
          </p>
          <p>
          One struggle I have been having is managing my time. There is an estimated time to complete each assignment on the agenda but I tend to spend more than that. I have to wonder if I am not managing my time correctly or not. I have been using a stop watch on <a href=http://www.online-stopwatch.com/full-screen-stopwatch/>Online-Stopwatch</a> to keep track of how many hours I have spent per assignment and hopefully can use this data to improve my time management.
