On my first week in Phase 0, I was asked to take the [Thinking Style Quiz][thinking style] and here are my scores:

  1. Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random: 40
  2. Abstract Random: 24
  3. Abstract Sequential: 16

As you can see, based on the score my weakness is Abstract Sequential. This means I am not good with abstract material. The detailed explanation on [here][learning] provides more information about all four thinking styles.

After reflecting a bit, I think that is usally the case. It normally takes longer for me to understand abstract material. However, once I can pick up the abstract materials, my learning curve runs wild.

Besides CSS positioning, I did not have much problems solving problems in the last three weeks in phase 0. I solved this week Ruby's challenges pretty quickly. However, I think it is the results of spending a lot of time with Ruby many months ago. I spent a lot of time solving problems on [CoderByte][coderbyte]. Because of that, I was able to understand Ruby pretty well.

One struggle I have been having is managing my time. There is an estimated time to complete each assignment on the agenda but I tend to spend more than that. I have to wonder if I am not managing my time correctly or not. I have been using a stop watch on [Online-Stopwatch][stopwatch] to keep track of how many hours I have spent per assignment and hopefully can use this data to improve my time management.
