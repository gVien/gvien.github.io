This week's cultural blog is conflict. What would I do to solve a conflict? it was hard to recall events such as conflicts as I don't normally keep events such as conflicts in my memory bank for that long.

Thinking a bit deeper, I remember one conflict I had before was at work. I got into an argument with one of my coworkers over an assignment that we worked on but did not communicate with each other. It was an assignment (or product) that she claimed ownership of but I thought that it was fine to work on it since I had been working on improving that product many times in the past before. I did communicate with her but she did not understand why I would meddle in her space and began working on that assignment. I might have tried to overcommunicate as she did not want to hear me out anymore and we stopped talking to each other for a couple hours. At that time, I felt annoyed and did not know why she would not hear me out regarding that assignment.
A couple hours later, I decided to go apologize to her. I went to her cubicle and apologized. We communicated our differences and resolved the issue. She mentioned that she had already started on the assignment and did not like that I did not communicate to her when I first worked on it. At that point, it was clear to me what the problem was. I told her I would give her what I had done for that assignment and she could use it if she wanted to.

Communication is one of the most important tool to use to resolve a conflict and what I did in that conflict was started the conversation to try to resolve the conflict even though I felt that it was not fault that we miscommunicated. In addition, apologizing does not mean that that a person is wrong; it can mean that that person initiates the process to resolve a problem.

If I were to go back to that conflict again, I would do the same to resolve it. I figure that she was my co-worker and it did not make sense to be mad at each other for that long. We had work to do and the sooner we resolve it the better our relationship.
