<p>
  This will be an introduction to Active Record as I just learned a little bit about it myself. 
</p>
<p>
  It's best to talk about databases such as SQLite before we dive into Active Record so that you will know why it is such a useful tool. In a dabases software, you would normally retrieve information by typing <code>SELECT * FROM ... WHICH ... ORDER BY ...</code> and your database software will return the information you requested. In a web application, this would be too tedious (I admit that I have never done it but from what I read it looks that this task might consume a lot of the developers time). In addition, I cannot imagine what the codes look like if this is stricly implemented in Ruby.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, we have Active Record that handles the retrieval and creation of data for us, so we don't have to worry about these sort of things. As Ruby/Rails developers, we would not be worrying about database commands.
</p>
<p>
  What exactly is Active Record? it is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that is responsible for all dabase interaction from the application level. The name is based on the Active Record Pattern identified in Martin Fowler's 2003 book <i>Patterns of Enterprise</i>.
</p>
<p>
  CRUD is used to interact with data. CRUD stands for "Create, Read, Update, and Detele". Here is a quick overview of what each does:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Create:</strong> We can create We can create an ActiveRecord object by simply instantiating it just like a class in Ruby. For example, if you already have a Post model in your application, you can create it with <code>Post.new</code>. You can also do <code>Post.create(some_name:"some string", other_item: "some other string")</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Read:</strong> The read is the retrieving part. You can read the post object with <code>Post.first</code> or <code>Post.last</code>. Of course there are plenty other powerful read methods.</li>
    <li><strong>Update:</strong> you update by overwriting an object. If your object variable is <code>t</code> that stores a tweet then you can update it with <code>t.content = "new tweet"</code> and then you update/save it with <code>t.save</code>./li>
    <li><strong>Delete:</strong>you delete an entry by calling the <code>destroy</code> method. For example, you can do <code>t.destroy</code></li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  I hope this very brief introduction to Active Record will give you an idea what it is and how useful it is in a web application.
