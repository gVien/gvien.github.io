After a week of HTML and CSS, I had a chance to use it to complete this website, although it needs more fine-tuning in the next few weeks.

The hardest part of styling this page was to get the 3 blocks to position inline horizontally to each other underneath the header. It sounds easy but it is not; my other classmates also had difficulty with position.

While working on this, I pondered about ID and Class selectors even though I mostly use Class selectors. In the back of my mind, I thought they are the same since you can use either one to do your styling and it still works. However, after digging further, I learn that by convention they should not be abused and used excessively especially IDs.

IDs should be unique while Classes do not need to be unique. This means we can use the same classes on different elements but not for IDs. In addition, IDshave special browser functionality. What do I mean by that? when we click something on a link on a table of contents, we normally see something like http://www.domain.com/#domain, this is an attempt by the browser to locate the ID "domain" and it points to it.

As you can see, having IDs to be unique are important. And I will make sure to not use the same IDs throughout my design!
