This week we are given an assignment to research a technology problem that we are facing in the modern world and give a brief background of it, and then propose a possible solution. The truth is even though I use technology (using a smartphone/computer, driving a car, etc.) everyday to make life easier, I never consider much about a technology problem we are facing until...now.

<h3 id="html">The Problem</h3>

One of our biggest problems we are facing today is getting everyone connected to the internet. As reported by the [LA Times][latime] 60% of the world's population was not able to connect to the Internet by the end of last year (2014). Face bought a UK aerospace company, Ascenta to build drones to beam Internet access to the ground. Google started [Project Loon][googlellon] to build Ballon that can provide internet access to the people on the ground. These are great soutions, however I would like to propose another solution!

Currently, cellphone (or smartphone) users are able to obtain internet access through cell site or cell tower in various parts of the world. I think in addition to using air-balloons and/or drones, we can build a mobile cell tower (can be a van or truck) on the ground and this mobile cell tower can be moved from location to location. In addition, the mobile cell tower can be interconnected which may help improve its signal strength. I think this solution is cheaper than the drone solution as it does not require as much research and development to build a mobile cell tower. We can also embed the mobile cell tower with driverless technology that many companies such as Google and Tesla are working on.

Thanks for reading!
