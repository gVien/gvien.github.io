Who says changing career was easy? it is if you choose DBC! 
So far I am
learning a lot during first week of Phase 0, not just coding but also writing
as well. Until recently, I thought a programmer is shy and would only code. It
seems that DBC breaks this mentality out of my head. All the reflection that I
have done helps me recall a lot of the materials covered in the first week. In
addition, I thought we would dive into Ruby, Javascript, and HTML/CSS right
away but it appears not as the emhasis on the first week was more on command-
line interface that all programmers should know. I am learning the fundamental
of computer programming which I understand will help me tremendously in the
coming weeks.

After watching one of the founders [speak][1], I certainly agree that you need
to have the right mentality to succeed. This also reminds me of the mindset
articles by Researcher Carol Dweck on [Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset][2]
and also [Nine Things Successful People Do Differently][3], which are all
inspiring.

After a busy week, I look forward to the curriculum for next week.
Furthermore, I can see myself thriving in this learning environment at DBC. I
was a bit nervous after I got accepted a few weeks ago but the nervousness
faded away. DBC does not just teach you to code, they also teach you

Thanks for reading!
