Being able to ask good question is the blog topic for the last week of Phase 0 at DBC before I begin phase 1 which is the onsite portion.

I could not agree more after reading [How do I ask a good question?][question] and [Writing the Perfect Question][perfect].

Being able to ask good question is one of the most important skills a person possesses or acquires. By good I mean a person should ask a question that anyone who sees it can answer it and he or she does not need more information or clarification. For example, asking this question on a forum "how do you solve this?" will probably get a lot of negative feedback. Although extreme, no one would be able to answer this question as it is too broad. Rather than asking that question, one can narrow it down to something like "Why does Ruby irb return a whole number when doing integer division?" which would not scratch anyone's head what the questioner would want.

When a person asks a good question in real life, forum, or any platform, he or she may be able to get the desired answers immediately. He or she would not be wasting time clarifying the questions if it is not clear enough. In real life, it does not take long to clarify a question but on a forum a person has to clarify the question, then wait for another response. This would take a while. If the person asks a good question at the beginning, this process would greatly reduced and he or she would be saving more time to do other things.

Looking back at some of the earlier posts I asked at [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow], I made several mistakes while asking a [quesion to solve a string scramble problem][stringquestion]. I did not get the answer I was looking for as the person who tried to answer my question mentioned. This, in turn, wasted time his or her time as he or she answered the question I did not mean to ask. <em>I replied back and clarified my question that I wanted to actually "solve" the problem using loopings (instead of Ruby's methods) but he or she did not provide a new answer because he or she would be answering a different question, one that I did not clarify in the post.</em>

In order to get the answer I wanted, I either needed start another post and be more specific on my question (favorable) or update my current post with the clarified question (not very favorable). The latter is not favorable because the person would need to update his or her answer to match with my updated question and this is not a good practice on Stack Overflow.

As you can see this process took more time than needed. I could be using that time to try to solve the problem I asked. I think that this is also part of good time management as well. Asking good question is a skill everyone should practice!
