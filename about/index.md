Hi there, thanks for dropping by and welcome!

My name is Gai Vien and I am software developer. Prior to being a developer, I was a mechanical/manufacturing engineer. I started doing software development on my own for a while before committing myself to attending a bootcamp in San Francisco to further improve my skills. I recently contracted with Beepi to rebuild and rebrand some of their pages such as financing, leasing, blog, career, etc.

Currently, I am seeking a full-time opportunity, where I can continue to challenge myself, learn new technologies, and help the company solve complex problems. If you are looking for a passionate and self-driven software engineer, please feel free to <a href="mailto: wavetech86@gmail.com">contact me</a>. You can also see my resume [here](/resume/).

Feel free to connect with me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaivien" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. You can also check out my <a href="https://github.com/gVien" target="_blank">Github</a> profile for sample of my codes. I also share my knowledge through blogging, so check out my blog section [here](/blog/).
