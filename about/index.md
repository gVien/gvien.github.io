Hello there, welcome to my page! Thanks for stopping by.

I am a former Aerospace/Mechanical Engineer, though I spent many years practicing my Mechanical Engineering credential more than my Aerospace credential. However, I am still a space fan; that's why you see many space pictures in the background of my [home page][home].

[home]: https://gvien.github.io

I left all this behind to become a developer, as I have grown increasingly interest in technology in recent years. I am currently enrolled in Dev Bootcamp for the next several months to study to become a software engineer.
You can say this is a website that document the journey I go through to become a developer! Take a look at my blog, projects, or you can connect me on <a href="https://twitter.com/GaiVien">twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/gVien">Github!</a>
