        <h2>Phase 0 Week 1: My Experience at DBC</h2>
        <h4>May 3rd, 2015</h4>
        <section>
          <p>
            Who says changing career was easy? it is if you choose DBC! So far I am learning a lot during first week of Phase 0, not just coding but also writing as well. Until recently, I thought a programmer is shy and would only code. It seems that DBC breaks this mentality out of my head. All the reflection that I have done helps me recall a lot of the materials covered in the first week. In addition, I thought we would dive into Ruby, Javascript, and HTML/CSS right away but it appears not as the emhasis on the first week was more on command-line interface that all programmers should know. I am learning the fundamental of computer programming which I understand will help me tremendously in the coming weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            After watching one of the founders <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">speak</a>, I certainly agree that you need to have the right mentality to succeed. This also reminds me of the mindset articles by Researcher Carol Dweck on <a href="http://examinedexistence.com/carol-dweck-on-fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset/">Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset</a> and also <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/02/nine-things-successful-people/">Nine Things Successful People Do Differently</a>, which are all inspiring. 
          </p>
          <p>
             After a busy week, I look forward to the curriculum for next week. Furthermore, I can see myself thriving in this learning environment at DBC. I was a bit nervous after I got accepted a few weeks ago but the nervousness faded away. DBC does not just teach you to code, they also teach you to be a better person!

            Thanks for reading!
