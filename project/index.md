Below are some of my projects I have worked on during my time at Dev Bootcamp. Please click on the specific link to find out more about the project.

1. [Simple Grocery List](grocery-list/grocery_list.html) - A basic Javascript web-app grocery list I built during Phase 0 (remote phase of Dev Bootcamp). This was one of my first Javascript web-apps.

2. [Treasure-Hunt](treasure-hunt.html) - This was my first Javascript game I made using HTML5/Canvas, CSS, and Javascript/DOM manipulation. The goal of the game is to collect all the gold bullions while avoiding the mines. On top of that, you only have 100 moves to collect all bullions.

3. [Stock-Exchange](finance-exchange) - A web app that provides information of publicly traded company and connects traders/investors.

4. [Financial-Chart](financial-chart) - An extension of Finance-Exchange app that leverages the power of <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> and the stock price data from Yahoo Finance API to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart" target="_blank">Candlestick charts</a>. The chart can help technical analysts estimate the future price of a stock.

  1. after getting a disqus account, you will be creating a "short name" (e.g. thisisyourshortname.disqus.com)
  2. put that name within the quote `...` below in the disqus_shortname variable
