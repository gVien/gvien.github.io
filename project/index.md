1. [Stock-Exchange](finance-exchange) - A web app that provides information of publicly traded company and connects traders/investors.

2. [Financial-Chart](financial-chart) - An extension of Finance-Exchange app that leverages the power of <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> and the stock price data from Yahoo Finance API to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart" target="_blank">Candlestick charts</a>. The chart can help technical analysts estimate the future price of a stock.

3. [Chariteer](chariteer) - Chariteer (<span class="chariteer">Chari</span>ty + Volun<span class="chariteer">teer</span>) connects volunteers with charities to build better communities.

4. [PaperTrading](Papertrading) (Deployment coming soon but you can take a sneak peak of the process!) - When major events, such as the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/15/investing/ebola-spooks-wall-street-investors-stocks/" target="_blank">Ebola epidemic in 2014</a> or <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21662092-china-sneezing-rest-world-rightly-nervous-causes-and-consequences-chinas" target="_blank">Chinese Stock Market Crash in 2015</a>, crash the US financial market, people are scared to pour their hard earned money in a brokerage firm to invest in the stock market. PaperTrading obliterates this fear by giving people the opportunity to hone their trading skills with virtual trading platform using real market data. Any trading loss will not dent their wallet or cause them to loss sleep but any wins will boost their confidence level and make them feel they can beat the market again. With improved skills, people can start investing and beating the financial market again.
